Domain Controllers:

 The tasks of a domain controller below: 

    - holds the AD DS data store 
    - handles authentication and authorization services 
    - replicate updates from other domain controllers in the forest
    - Allows admin access to manage domain resources


============================================================================================================
﻿Forest 

The Forest consists of these parts which we will go into farther detail with later:

   - Trees - A hierarchy of domains in Active Directory Domain Services
   - Domains - Used to group and manage objects 
   - Organizational Units (OUs) - Containers for groups, computers, users, printers and other OUs
   - Trusts - Allows users to access resources in other domains
   - Objects - users, groups, printers, computers, shares
   - Domain Services - DNS Server, LLMNR, IPv6
   - Domain Schema - Rules for object creation

===============================================================================================================
- Users + Groups 
	Users 

	- The four types of users are: 

		- Domain Admins 
		- Service Accounts
		- Local Administrators 
		- Domain Users 
================================================================================================================
- Default Security Groups 
	Here is a brief outline of the security groups:

    		- Domain Controllers 	==> All domain controllers in the domain
    		- Domain Guests 	==> All domain guests
    		- Domain Users 		==> All domain users
    		- Domain Computers 	==> All workstations and servers joined to the domain
    		- Domain Admins 	==> Designated administrators of the domain
    		- Enterprise Admins 	==> Designated administrators of the enterprise
    		- Schema Admins 	==> Designated administrators of the schema
    		- DNS Admins 		==> DNS Administrators Group
		- Protected Users 	==>  Members of this group are afforded additional protections against 								authentication security threats. 
    		- DNS Update Proxy 	==> DNS clients who are permitted to perform dynamic updates on behalf of 						some other clients (such as DHCP servers).
    		- Allowed RODC Password Replication Group ==> Members in this group can have their passwords 							replicated to all read-only domain controllers in the domain
    		- Group Policy Creator Owners ==> Members in this group can modify group policy for the domain
    		- Denied RODC Password Replication Group ==> Members in this group cannot have their passwords 									replicated to any read-only domain controllers in the domain
    		
    		- Cert Publishers 	==>  Members of this group are permitted to publish certificates to the 						directory
    		- Read-Only Domain Controllers ==>   Members of this group are Read-Only Domain Controllers in the 							domain
    		- Enterprise Read-Only Domain Controllers ==>   Members of this group are Read-Only Domain 									Controllers in the enterprise
    		Key Admins 		==>   Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects 						within the domain.
    		- Enterprise Key Admins ==>   Members of this group can perform administrative actions on key objects 						within the forest.
    		- Cloneable Domain Controllers ==>   Members of this group that are domain controllers may be cloned.
    							RAS and IAS Servers - Servers in this group can access remote 							access properties of users
